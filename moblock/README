MoBlock README v0.2
http://moblock.berlios.de

.Introduction.

   MoBlock is a linux console application that blocks connections from/to hosts
   listed in a file in peerguardian format (guarding.p2p).
   It uses iptables ipqueue library and it is very light in resource
   usage. I test it on an old Celeron 400 Mhz and its cpu usage has only spikes
   at 5% under normal usage (edonkey, bittorrent etc...).


.Requirements.

1) iptables and kernel support for connection and state tracking (
   ip_conntrack,ipt_state) and ip_queue kernel modules/built-in.
   This are the kernel modules i have with MoBlock running
   on 2.6.9-ac6:
	
	iptable_filter          2016  1
	ipt_state               1312  4
	ip_conntrack           37716  1 ipt_state
	ip_tables              14496  2 iptable_filter,ipt_state
	ip_queue                7608  0

2) A valid guarding.p2p host file in /etc ( /etc/guarding.p2p ).
   MoBlock tries to skip malformed or duplicate ranges but
   if it founds something unexpected it segfaults :P
   
   Update: Thanks to Andrew de Quincey patch MoBlock now uses regular
   expressions to load the guarding file so this should not be
   a problem anymore.
   In my tests i used lists from http://methlabs.org

3) Minimum iptables knowledge (or trust my start script).
   MoBlock filter only packets that are QUEUEd with iptables. So it's up
   to you to choose what traffic you want to be filtered.
   For example if you want MoBlock to filter all the new TCP connections
   that are initiated from your box:

	iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -j QUEUE

   A simple start script (MoBlock.sh) is provided that makes MoBlock
   filter all new incoming and outgoing connections, both for tcp and udp.
   
   !!! While MoBlock is active it is needed an explicit iptables rule to
   accept localhost-to-locahost connections:
   
   iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 127.0.0.1 -d 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
   iptables -I INPUT -p udp -s 127.0.0.1 -d 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
   
   They will be dropped with a connection reset if you don't ACCEPT them.
   I'm still investigating about this issue. 
   Provided start script has already these rules.


.Installation & Usage.

   Just untar somwhere.
   To build MoBlock from sources just do:
   
   cd src
   make
   cp MoBlock ../

   Binary version is compiled on Slackware 10.0 current with gcc 3.4.2
   To start it just launch MoBlock.sh as root, for example:

   ./MoBlock.sh &

   By default it will load the block list from /etc/guarding.p2p and
   will log its activity to ./MoBlock.log, you can edit MoBlock.sh if you
   want to change them.
   
   To stop it:

   kill -HUP <MoBlockPid> 
   or
   kill -TERM <MoBlockPid>

   While shutting down it will dump some stats to /var/log/MoBlock.stats
   To obtain stats about blocked ranges while it's running:

   kill -USR1 <MoBlockPid>	# write stats to logfile
   kill -USR2 <MoBlockPid>      # write stats to /var/log/MoBlock.stats
